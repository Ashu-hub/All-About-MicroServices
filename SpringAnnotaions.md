# Spring Core Framework Annotations:-
1.	@Required:-
	This is applied on bean setter method. This enforces that affected bean must be populated at configuration time.

2. @Autowired:-
	This can be applied on Feild, Setter Method or constructor. It Injects object dependency implicitly.

3.	@Qualifier:-
	This annotation is used with @Annotation. When you want more control on dependency injection.
	[More On..](https://springframework.guru/spring-framework-annotations/)

4. @Configuration:-
	This is used on class which defined the beans. It is analog to XML Configuration file.
	
5. @ComponentScan:-
	This annotation allows the spring to know the packages to scan. It by default scans base Package in which @ComponentScan class is defined.
	One can use *basePackages* attribute to define different packages other than base package.

6.	@Bean:-
	@Bean vs @Component:-
	Both the annotations aims to register target type in Spring Container. 
	Diff is @Bean is applicable to methods while @Component is applicable to types(like Classes)
		
7. 	@Lazy:-
	This is used on Component classes. BY Default all autowired dependencies are created  and configured startup, but if you to initialize bean lazyly, you can use this.

8. @Value:-
	//This is used with field, constructor or method parameter. It signifies the default value experssion for the feild/constructor/parameter.
	This is used to read the application appplication property.
	like - @Value("${spring.application.name}")
			OR
	give default values as :
	@Value("${spring.application.name:defaultName}")

# Spring Framework Stereotype Annotations
1. @Component:-
	It register the target type in spring Container. Used for Classes.

2. @Controller:
	This annotations is used to indicate Spring Container that this the class is Spring Controller Class.
	It allow Auto-detection of component classes in the classpath and auto regitering bean defination for them.
	This class is capable for handling multiple request mapping.

3. @Service:
	This marks a class that performs a service. It is used in Service layer
	
4. @Repository:
	This annotations used in the class which directly access the database. It is used as marker that fullfill the role of Repository.
	This annotations ha automatic translatioin feature. Eg: when an exception occured in the @Repository Class, there is a handler for that exception. no need for Try catch block.

# Spring Boot Annotations:-

1. @EnableAutoConfiguration:-
	It Automatically configures your spring application based on the dependencies provides in the class path

2.	@SpringBootApplication
	It is entry point of Spring Boot Application. It actually scans the whole package and sub packages.
	It is combination of below 3 annotations:-
	@ComponentScan
	@EnableAutoConfiguration
	@Configuration


3. [@ResponseBody:](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-request-response-body)
	The @ResponseBody annotation tells a controller that the object returned is automatically serialized into JSON and passed back into the HttpResponse object.

4. @RestController - 
	Class LEvel Annotation. Makes a class Rest Controller. 
	@RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody
	
	
	
# Spring MVC and Rest Annotations:-
1. @RequestMapping:
	
	
- **Differenc between @PathVariable and @RequestParam**
	
	**@RequestParam** - It is used to extract query parameters.
		example -  http://localhost:8080/eportal/trades?tradeId=2001
		
		@RequestMapping("/trades")
		public String showTradeDetails(@RequestParam String tradeId,
                               Model model){
							   ...
		}
	
	**@PathVariable **- It is used to extract values from URI
	example - http://localhost:8080/book/9783827319333
	
	RequestMapping(value="/book/{ISBN}", method= RequestMethod.GET)
	public String showBookDetails(@PathVariable("ISBN") String id,
                              Model model){
							  ..
							  }
