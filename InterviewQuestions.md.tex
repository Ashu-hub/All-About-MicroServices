# MicroServices Interview Questions

1. What is Microservices Architecture?
	It is architectural pattern, which defines services as small, loosely coupled, distributed service.

2. What are the pros/cons. of the Microservices architecture style?
	Pros: 
		* Improved falut tolerance- Larger application can remian mostly unaffected by the failure of single module.
		* Ease of Understanding -With added simpicity, developer can have better understandibilty of the funtionality.
		* Eliminate Technolofy lock in- MS provide flexibilty to use different technology stack in different services.
		* Smaller and faster development- smallar and disintegreated codebase = quicker development
		* Scalability- Since your application is small you can scale it seperately, whenever needed.
		
	Cons:
		* Communication between services is complex/overhead-  Since there are more no of services, effiecient Intercommunication is a challenging task.
		* Global Testing is more complicated.
		* Deployment challenges- One need to deploy every service and it becomes challenging sometimes like generating war and deploying it in server.
		
3. How micro services interact with each other?
	We can use RestTeplate or Webclient-builder. 
	But we should not use them as it has boilerplate-code(lot of code needs to write for a small work) to call and get the response.
	Insted we should use Feign client to use for communication.
